Train car connection logic using linked lists and OOP in Java

## 🚂 Overview
This project simulates a train logistics system where train cars must be connected based on shared characteristics: freight type, weight, or refrigerated temperature (for reefers). Cars are added to a train if they meet strict connection rules, forming a doubly linked list.

## 📌 Features
- `TrainCar` and `Reefer` classes using inheritance
- Freight-type and weight-based connection logic
- Temperature-based connection rules for reefers
- Exception handling for invalid connections
- Manual doubly linked list structure (no built-in Java collections)

## 🧠 Key Skills
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Linked list implementation
- Custom exception handling in Java
- Programming to specifications
